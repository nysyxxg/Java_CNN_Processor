# Java_CNN_Processor
Process Java Files using the Convolutional Neural Networking.

# Milestone I
	Classify the Java classes based on the project/class characteristics like whether itâ€™s a CORE_JAVA, SPRING based or JPA class. For achieving the same we are using the Convolutional Neural Network mechanism. 

	Convolutional neural network is basically for the Image Processing then defiantly a questions will come, How Java Classes are classified using CNN? In this project we are trying to giving an answer for this Question.
