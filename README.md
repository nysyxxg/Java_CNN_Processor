# Java_CNN_Processor
Process Java Files using the Convolutional Neural Networking.

# Milestone I
Classify the Java classes based on the project/class characteristics like whether itâ€™s a CORE_JAVA, SPRING based or JPA class. For achieving the same we are using the Convolutional Neural Network mechanism. Convolutional neural network is basically for the Image Processing then defiantly a questions will come, how it process the Java Classes? In this project we are trying to given an answer for this Question.
